# Laser Turret
 
An automatated turret that shoots lasers. Can be used for cats and is made with the arduino uno, breadboard, laser pointer, and 2 micro servos.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone was getting everything connected. I put the laser in a tube so it wouldn't fall apart, glued the servos atop a can for elevation, and revised the code. Issues I ran into while doing the project was getting everything to stick. At first, I used many layers of tape to get the servos and lasers attached. However, this proved to be pretty useless because the tape wasn't strong enough to hold everything together. I overcame this by using hot glue, which was much more sufficent and attached everything pretty quickly. It was also relatively easy to remove as long as it wasn't totally dry and wet. Another challenge was that the pen kept hitting the table because tof the specific rotations it had to perform. I solved this by adding some elevation to the design (canned quail eggs). This allowed it to do its full rotation without interruptions

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was getting both of the servos plus the laser to work. The servos were pretty challenging as only one of the servos worked while the other didn't work. After a while of trial and error and youtube tutorials, I found out that certain wires need to go to certain areas. This allowed me to make the servos spin 180 degrees after I finished connecting all the wires into the right spots. The laser was pretty easy to work as all I had to do we plug it into the breadboard. However, i need to connect it to jumper cables in order to increase the length of the laser. This is so it can fit on the final design as I need it to shoot all around the place. This means it needs to be elevated. Increasing the length would prove to be benefitical. The next steps for this project is probably going to be designing the structure so it is compact and able to work as intended.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was to get the servo to start working. This was an extremely daunting task as I had barely any experience. I had to watch youtube videos and look at different websites in order to find out what to do. I followed a schematic and copied some code and the servo finally started working. The next steps for this project is probably getting both of the servos working as well as the laser to work.
